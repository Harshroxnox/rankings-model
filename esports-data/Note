Important Note Regarding the data extraction

While writing the python script for extracting data from the tournaments file I was having problems on how to extract the players data so I 
have left that out for now and for the sake of simplicity.
 
If time permits I will go back and extract the data of all players as well but for now I just want to make a baseline machine learning model
and at least get a starting point
